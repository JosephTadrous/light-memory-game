## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

[No I haven't used any outside resources]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

[I didn't face any significant challenges during this prework. The instructions were very clear and to the point. The one problem I faced was that the stop button didn't disappear when clicked on. I figured that I wrote the function incorrectly (document.getElementbyId("stopBtn") instead of document.getElementById("stopBtn")). It's a minor problem, and I figured it out using the console.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

[After completing this project, I have many questions regarding web development. How can we improve the accessibility of the websites we build? How to design aesthetically appealing websites? What are the other best tools besides CSS to improve the UI design of our websites? How do we build responsive websites that can adjust to any screen sizes and any devices? Why are some backend technologies more popular than others? How do we know which backend technologies will be better for our websites?]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

[If I had more hours to work on this project, I would spend some time improving the user interface of the website to make it aesthetically appealing to the user. I would also make the game more challenging and fun by either adding more buttons to the game or by speeding up the game. In addition, I would give the user different difficulties modes to choose from (easy/medium/hard), and I will alter the game speed/time for guess/number of buttons in accordance with the difficulty mode chosen. I will also let the program generate random patterns to make the game more interesting. Moreover, I would add a warning for people with Photosensitive epilepsy before starting the game beacuse they can be affected by the visual cues in the game.]
